This is a dice poker game for two or more players who works when the players are in the same party or raid.
The objective is to achieve the best combination in two dice rolls. The first player is the one who won the previous round. A normal game is played with six pieces per player.

- Everyone starts by betting one coin.
- Then the players all make a first roll of the dice.
- Each player can announce if they increase the bet by an additional piece and continue the round, or fold and drop out of the round, losing their bet.
- When everyone has followed or folded, each player selects the dice they wish to reroll, then rerolls them.
- The combination of the highest value wins and the winner takes the pot!

If you don't have any coins for playing, you can take a (fun) penalty and gain two coins!

List of combinations in order of value:

- Poker: Five dice of the same value
- 4-of-a-Kind: Four dice of the same value
