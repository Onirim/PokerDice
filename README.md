Documentation:

This is a dice poker game for two or more players. 
The objective is to achieve the best combination in two dice 
rolls. The first player is the one who won the previous round. 
A normal game is played with six pieces per player.

- Everyone starts by betting one piece.
- Then the players all make a first roll of the dice, in 
clockwise order.
- Starting with the first player, each player can announce 
if they increase the bet by an additional piece. In this 
case, everyone who wants to follow must also bet one more 
piece. Players who do not follow fold and drop out of the 
round, losing their bet. The bet can only be increased once 
per round, for all players.
- When everyone has followed or folded, each player selects 
the dice they wish to reroll, then rerolls them.

The combination of the highest value wins and the 
winner takes the pot!

List of combinations in order of value:

- POKER: Five dice of the same value
- 4-OF-A-KIND: Four dice of the same value
- FULL HOUSE: A three-of-a-kind + a pair
- GREAT STRAIGHT: Dice sequence ranging from 2 to 6
- SMALL STRAIGHT Dice sequence ranging from 1 to 5
- 3-OF-A-KIND: Three dice of the same value
- DOUBLE PAIR: Two pairs
- PAIR: Two dice of the same value

When the combinations are of equal value, the one that 
has the highest dice is declared the winner!
